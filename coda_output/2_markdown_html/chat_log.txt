Revised Description:
Update the shell script to ensure the 'markdown' Python package is installed before running the Python program. The script should check for the package and install it if necessary, then proceed to convert the README.md file to README.html. Additionally, ensure that the installation path for user-installed scripts is included in the PATH environment variable to avoid warnings.
