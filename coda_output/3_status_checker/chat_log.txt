URL status check complete. Results are in status_report.txt.

STDERR:
  WARNING: The script normalizer is installed in '/home/coda/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

Revised Description:
Create a shell script to automate the following task: Develop and execute a Python program that reads a list of URLs from a file named `urls.txt` and checks if each website is online by verifying an HTTP status of 200. The program should output the results to a file named `status_report.txt`, indicating each URL and whether it is 'Online' or 'Offline'. Ensure the Python `requests` library is installed, and handle any installation warnings by adding the installation path to the system's PATH if necessary. The working directory is `/workspace`.
