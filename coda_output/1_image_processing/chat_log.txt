Revised Description:
Update the shell script to ensure the Python Imaging Library (PIL) is installed before running the image processing utility. Modify the script to include a step for installing the `Pillow` package, which provides the `PIL` module. The revised script should:

1. Navigate to the working directory.
2. Install the `Pillow` package using `pip`.
3. Create a Python script that reads `input.png`, flips it horizontally, converts it to grayscale, and rescales it to 256x256 pixels, saving the result as `output.png`.
4. Execute the Python script.
